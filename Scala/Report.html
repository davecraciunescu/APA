<h3><a id="Report_in_the_assignments_proceedings_6"></a>Report in the assignment’s proceedings</h3>
<p>Just as the first assignment, the objective of the practice is to create the<br>
well-known game <strong>2048</strong>. Although this time, the development is performed under<br>
the Scala programming language. It has been pursued the knowledge of the<br>
functinal programming.</p>
<h3><a id="Assignments_insight_13"></a>Assignment’s insight</h3>
<p>As for process carried out to develop de project, there have been followed the<br>
following dogmas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functional programming specified in the Scala documentation.</li>
<li>The usage of inmutable fields and variables to avoid data corruption:<br>
** Such us for example an inmutable list formed by inmutable values.</li>
<li>An interface design utilizing console ASCII Art in order to get the user into<br>
a more inmersive visual experience.</li>
<li>The utilization of a thorough planning, including details such as the progress<br>
obtained in the specific task, the developer of that task…</li>
<li>A live system, to increase competitiveness of the users.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="Breakdown__Compulsory_Assignment_27"></a>Breakdown - Compulsory Assignment</h3>
<p>The mandatory part of the assignment has been developed following the system<br>
specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Game difficulty: Selected by the user at the beginning of the execution.<br>
** From level 1 to level 4 (the lower the easier the game is).<br>
** Each difficulty level has different board size.</li>
<li>Board display: Also showing the different movements, lives available…</li>
<li>Tiles merge: Each time two same-valued tiles collide one another, they are<br>
merged into one tile with a value equal to their addition.<br>
** Tiles can only be merged once per movement.</li>
<li>Merged-tiles count.</li>
<li>Allowed movements: Must be checked whether the selected movement is valid.</li>
<li>Game over: Just after the board is full, and no other movements can be<br>
performed.</li>
<li>Points count: As it has been pointed before, each time two tiles merge, they<br>
also merge their values. That is going to be the method used to compute the<br>
points obtained.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="Breakdown__Optimized_Assignmet_47"></a>Breakdown - Optimized Assignmet</h3>
<p>It has been a development decision to include the next perk to the system:</p>
<ul>
<li>As an improvement, it has been included a basic automated playing-mode system,<br>
in which the user does not need to intervene in order for the board to move.</li>
</ul>
