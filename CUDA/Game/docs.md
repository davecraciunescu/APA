# Analysis.
- Data flow from user or external files to system, internally in the system
  between every relevant component or storage, and from system to user or
  external files.

- ADT Specifications.
    - Explanations of the adaptations made to the standard specification of the
      ADT to fit requirements. If any ADT is used more than once, its
      description must be repreated for every case of stated to be the same than
      previous.

    - Reasoning on convenience or need of use of Dynamic DS in every case,
      comparing with static DS characteristics.

    - Definition of operations of the ADT.
        - Name, arguments and return values.

# Design.
- Diagram of the representation of the ADT in the memory of the computer (box
  diagrams) and explanations of every operation.
- UML Diagram and Class diagram.
- Explanation of the classes.
    - Explanation of ADT methods. Including those created for operations and any
      other needed.
    - Explanation of the behavior of the program.

# Implementation.
- Explanation of every difficult section of the program.

# Review.
- Running time of the solution.
- Possible enhancements for the solution (in terms of efficiency and others)
